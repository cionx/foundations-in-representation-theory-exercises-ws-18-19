\subsection{}

We consider the induced long exact sequence in homology:
\[
  \dotsb
  \to
  \Hl_{n+1}( C''_\bullet )
  \to
  \Hl_n( C'_\bullet )
  \to
  \Hl_n( C_\bullet )
  \to
  \Hl_n( C''_\bullet )
  \to
  \Hl_{n-1}( C'_\bullet )
  \to
  \dotsb
\]
If~$C''_\bullet$ is acyclic then~$\Hl_n(C''_\bullet) = 0$ for every~$n \in \Integer$.
It then t follows from the long exact sequence that~$\Hl_n(C'_\bullet) \cong \Hl_n(C_\bullet)$ for every~$n \in \Integer$, and hence that~$C'_\bullet$ is acyclic if and only if~$C_\bullet$ is acylic.
We find in the same way that if~$C'_\bullet$ is acyclic then~$C_\bullet$ is acyclic if and only if~$C''_\bullet$ is acyclic.
The given statements follows immediatelly from these observations.

Note that we actually get from the long exact sequence that the morphism~$C'_\bullet \to C_\bullet$ is a {\qim} and only if if the chain complex~$C''_\bullet$ is acyclic, and that the morphism~$C_\bullet \to C''_\bullet$ is a {\qim} if and only if the chain complexe~$C'_\bullet$ is ayclic.





\subsection{}

With the canonical morphism~$p \colon C_\bullet \to \coim(f)$ we the following short exact sequence:
\[
  0
  \to
  \ker(f)
  \to
  C_\bullet
  \xlongto{p}
  \im(f)
  \to
  0 \,.
\]
It follows from~$\ker(f)$ being acylic that the morphism~$p$ is a {\qim}, as seen above.
We similarly find that the canonical morphism~$i \colon \im(f) \to D_\bullet$ is a {\qim} because~$\coker(f)$ is acyclic.
Together with the induced morphism~$\tilde{f} \colon \coim(f) \to \im(f)$, which is an isomorphism because~$\Ch_\bullet(\Acat)$ is abelian, we find that
\[
    f
  = i \tilde{f} p
\]
is a composition of three {\qim} and hence a {\qim} itself.
