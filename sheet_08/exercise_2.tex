\begin{lemma}
  \label{qim via acyclic}
  Let~$0 \to C'_\bullet \xto{f} C_\bullet \xto{g} C''_\bullet \to $ be a short exact sequence of chain complexes in~$\Acat$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      If~$C'_\bullet$ is acyclic then~$g$ is a {\qim}.
    \item
      If~$C''_\bullet$ is acyclic then~$f$ is a {\qim}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
  This follows from the long exact sequence in homology.
\end{proof}





\subsection{}

If~$C''_\bullet$ is acyclic then~$\Hl_n(C'_\bullet) \cong \Hl_n(C_\bullet)$ for every~$n \in \Integer$ by \cref{qim via acyclic}, and hence~$C'_\bullet$ is acyclic if and only if~$C_\bullet$ is acylic.
Similarly, if~$C'_\bullet$ is acyclic then~$C_\bullet$ is acyclic if and only if~$C''_\bullet$ is acyclic.
This shows together that if any two of the chain complexes~$C'_\bullet$,~$C_\bullet$,~$C''_\bullet$ are acyclic, then so is the third one.





\subsection{}

The canonical morphism~$p \colon C_\bullet \to \coim(f)$ fits into the short exact sequence
\[
  0
  \to
  \ker(f)
  \to
  C_\bullet
  \xlongto{p}
  \im(f)
  \to
  0 \,.
\]
It follows by \cref{qim via acyclic} from~$\ker(f)$ being acylic that the canonical morphism~$p$ is a {\qim}.
We similarly find that the canonical morphism~$i \colon \im(f) \to D_\bullet$ is a {\qim} because~$\coker(f)$ is acyclic.
The canonical induced morphism~$\tilde{f} \colon \coim(f) \to \im(f)$ is an isomorphism because~$\Ch_\bullet(\Acat)$ is abelian, and hence also a {\qim}.
We find that
\[
    f
  = i \tilde{f} p
\]
is a composition of three {\qim} and hence a {\qim} itself.
