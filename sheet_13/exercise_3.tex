\section{}

We know from the lecture that the~{\module{$A$}}~$\Hom_\Integer(A,\Rational/\Integer)$ is injective because~$\Rational/\Integer$ is injective (see Corollary~6.26).
We have seen in~\eqref{determining torsion of QZ} that
\[
  \Hom_\Integer(A,\Rational/\Integer)
  \cong
  A
\]
as abelian groups, and hence also~\dash{$A$}{modules}.
Thus~$A$ is injective as an~{\module{$A$}}.
