\section{}

We get from the short exact sequence~$0 \to X \to I \to Y \to 0$ a long exact sequence
\[
  0
  \to
  F(X)
  \to
  F(I)
  \to
  F(Y)
  \to
  (\Right^1 F)(X)
  \to
  (\Right^1 F)(I)
  \to
  \dotsb
\]
We know from the lecture that~$(\Right^n F)(I) = 0$ for every~$n \geq 1$ because~$I$ is injective.





\subsection{}

We get for every~$n \geq 1$ from the exactness of the sequence
\[
  0
  \to
  (\Right^n F)(Y)
  \to
  (\Right^{n+1} F)(X)
  \to
  0
\]
that the connecting morphism~$(\Right^n F)(Y) \to (\Right^{n+1} F)(X)$ is an isomorphism.





\subsection{}

We also get from the exactness of the sequence
\[
  F(I)
  \to
  F(Y)
  \to
  (\Right^1 F)(X)
  \to
  0
\]
that the connecting morphism~$F(Y) \to (\Right^1 F)(X)$ is a cokernel of~$F(I) \to F(Y)$.
