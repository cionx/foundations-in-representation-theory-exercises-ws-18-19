  \item[(i)~$\iff$~(ii):]
    That every object~$P \in \Ob(\Acat)$ is projective means that every short exact sequence~$0 \to X' \to X \to P \to 0$ ending in any object~$P \in \Ob(\Acat)$ splits.
  \item[(i)~$\iff$~(iii):]
    This equivalence follows from the equivalence~(i)~$\iff$~(ii) by duality.
  \item[(ii)~$\iff$~(iv):]
    An object~$P \in \Ob(\Acat)$ is projective if and only if the functor~$\Hom_{\Acat}(P,-)$ is exact (as known from the lecture).
  \item[(iii)~$\iff$~(v):]
    An object~$I \in \Ob(\Acat)$ is injective if and only if the functor~$\Hom_{\Acat}(-,I)$ is exact.
  \item[(iii),(v)~$\implies$~(vii):]
    For every object~$X \in \Ob(\Acat)$ one can use the identity~$\id_{X} \colon X \to X$ to see that the category~$\Acat$ has enough injective, because the object~$X$ is injective.
    That~$\Right^1 \Hom_{\Acat}(-,Y) = 0$ follows from~$\Hom_{\Acat}(-,Y)$ being exact.
  \item[(vii)~$\implies$~(iii):]
    It follows for every~$Y \in \Ob(\Acat)$ from~$\Right^1 \Hom_{\Acat}(-,Y) = 0$ that~$Y$ is injective.
  \item[(ii),(iv)~$\iff$~(vi):]
    This follows from the equivalence~(ii),~(v)~$\iff$~(vii) by duality.
