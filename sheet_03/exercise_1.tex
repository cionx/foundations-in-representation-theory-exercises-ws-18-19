\section{}

We define a category~$\Ccat$ whose objects are given by~$\Ob(\Ccat) = \Integer_{\geq 0}$ and where for any two nonnegative integers~$n, m \in \Integer_{\geq 0}$ the morphism set~$\Ccat(n,m)$ is given by the matrix space
\[
    \Ccat(n,m)
  = \mnat{m}{n}{k} \,.
\]
The compositions of morphisms in~$\Ccat$ is the usual matrix multiplication, which is associative.
The identity of an object~$n \in \Integer_{\geq 0}$ is given by the~\dash{$(n \times n)$}{identity} matrix~$I_n$.

We define a functor~$F \colon \Ccat \to \modl{k}$ by mapping any nonnegative integer~$n \in \Integer_{\geq 0}$ to the~{\kvs}~$F(n) = k^n$, and mapping any matrix~$A \in \mnat{m}{n}{k}$ to the~{\klin} map
\[
          F(A)
  \colon  k^n
  \to     k^m \,,
  \quad   x
  \mapsto Ax \,.
\]
We know from linear algebra that~$F$ is both fully faithful and essentially surjective, and hence an equivalence of categories.
