\subsection{}

Let~$M$ be a field and let~$f \colon M \to K = \Rational(i)$ and~$g \colon M \to L = \Rational(\sqrt{2})$ be field homomorphisms.
Then~$\Rational(i)$ and~$\Rational(\sqrt{2})$ are field extensions of~$M$.
The subfield of~$\Rational(i)$ are~$\Rational(i)$,~$\Rational$, and the subfield of~$\Rational(\sqrt{2})$ are~$\Rational(\sqrt{2})$,~$\Rational$;
the only isomorphic subfields of~$\Rational(i)$ and~$\Rational(\sqrt{2})$ are~$\Rational \subseteq \Rational(i)$ and~$\Rational \subseteq \Rational(\sqrt{2})$.
Hence we find that~$M = \Rational$.
There exist only a single field homorphism~$\Rational \to \Rational$, namely the identity~$\id_\Rational$.
Hence we find that~$M = \Rational$ and~$f = g = \id_\Rational$.

It follows that~$P = \Rational$ together with the inclusions~$p \colon P \to \Rational(i)$ and~$q \colon P \to \Rational(\sqrt{2})$ is a product of~$K$ and~$L$ in~$\Field$.
(That there exist a \emph{unique} morphism~$M \to P$ follows from~$\id_\Rational$ follows from~$\id_\Rational$ being the only such homomorphism.)





\subsection{}

Suppose that a product~$P$ of~$K$ and~$L$ exists in the category~$\Field$.
We find as above that~$P$ is isomorphic to a subfield of~$\Rational(i)$, and hence that either~$P = \Rational$ or~$P = \Rational(i)$.
It follows from the existence of the (usual) diagonal homomorphism~$\Delta_{\Rational(i)} \colon \Rational(i) \to P$ that~$P$ is a field extension of~$\Rational(i)$.
We thus find that~$P = \Rational(i)$.

There exists precisely two field homomorphisms~$\Rational(i) \to \Rational(i)$, the identity~$\id_{\Rational(i)}$ and the conjugation~$c \colon \Rational(i) \to \Rational(i)$,~$a + ib \mapsto a - ib$.
If~$p \colon P \to \Rational(i)$ and~$q \colon P \to \Rational(i)$ are the structure morphisms belonging to the product~$P$ then it follows that~$p$ and~$q$ are isomorphisms, and that for every choice of field homomorphisms~$f_1, f_2 \colon \Rational(i) \to \Rational(i)$ there exists a unique field homomorphism~$g \colon \Rational(i) \to \Rational(i)$ such that the diagram
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep = large]
      {}
    & P
      \arrow[bend right]{dl}[above left]{p}
      \arrow[bend left]{dr}[above right]{q}
    & {}
    \\
      \Rational(i)
    & \Rational(i)
      \arrow[dashed]{u}[right]{g}
      \arrow{l}[above]{f_1}
      \arrow{r}[above]{f_2}
    & \Rational(i)
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
commutes.
But then
\[
    f_1
  = p g
  = p q^{-1} f_2 \,,
\]
which cannot holds for both the choice~$f_1 = \id_{\Rational(i)}$,~$f_2 = \id_{\Rational(i)}$ (for which we get~$f_1 = f_2$) and also the choice~$f_1 = c$,~$f_2 = \id_{\Rational(i)}$ (for which we get~$f_1 \neq f_2$).

This shows that no product of~$K$ and~$L$ exists in~$\Field$.
